Britte's Gallery and Final Project for CS50
# Video Demo:  <"https://youtu.be/6qRwVetAoto">
# Description: For the final part of the Harvard CS50's course I have created a web based application including a gallery with products as it's main factor.
Things I developed are actions such as: Logging in, Logging out, Register and send a contactform (including a auto-response message).
I also focussed on the frontapp and used bootstrap and some CSS from W3School to make it look pretty! Media that were used are:
a favicon, pictures, a gif and for the error messages a picture with overlapping text (as in CS50's Finance). Last but not least I have created a database.
The database contains within the users table: an unique id, a username and a hash password (for privacy). I hope you enjoy!
